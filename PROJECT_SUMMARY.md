## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

You need .NET 8.0 or higher installed. Currently, you have .NET 9.0.8 runtime but need the SDK to build the project.

### Option 1: Install .NET SDK (Recommended)

```bash
# Remove existing dotnet runtime to avoid conflicts
brew uninstall --cask dotnet-runtime

# Install the full .NET SDK
brew install --cask dotnet-sdk
```

### Option 2: Use .NET 8.0 Runtime

If you prefer to keep .NET 9.0.8, you can install .NET 8.0 runtime alongside it:

```bash
# Download and install .NET 8.0 runtime from Microsoft
# Visit: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0
```

### Running the Application

Once you have the appropriate .NET version installed:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/sbr/sumu-lab-work/lab6

# Restore packages
dotnet restore

# Build the project
dotnet build

# Run the application
dotnet run
```

The application will start and be available at `https://localhost:5001` or `http://localhost:5000`.

## 🔍 Testing the CRUD Operations

### Create Operations

1. Navigate to any entity (Books, Shops, Customers, Orders, Inventory)
2. Click "Create New" button
3. Fill out the form with valid data
4. Submit and verify the record appears in the index

### Read Operations

1. View the index page for any entity
2. Click "Details" to see complete information
3. Verify related data is displayed correctly

### Update Operations

1. Click "Edit" on any record
2. Modify the information
3. Submit and verify changes are saved

### Delete Operations

1. Click "Delete" on any record
2. Confirm the deletion
3. Verify the record is removed from the index

### Validation Testing

Try submitting forms with:

- Empty required fields
- Invalid email formats
- Invalid ISBN formats
- Negative prices
- Invalid phone numbers

## 📊 Database Verification

After performing CRUD operations, you can verify database changes by:

1. Checking the SQLite database file: `BookshopManagement.db`
2. Using a SQLite browser to view table contents
3. Verifying foreign key relationships are maintained
4. Confirming data integrity after deletions

## 🎉 Project Success

The Bookshop Management System successfully demonstrates:

✅ **Complete CRUD Implementation**: All entities have full Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality
